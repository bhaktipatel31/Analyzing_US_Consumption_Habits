# Analyzing US Consumption Habits

The goal of this project is to conduct a preliminary study on consumer behavior in the US market for products sourced from a new origin. The analysis will explore how consumption varies with revenue and other drivers, investigate whether variations in consumption are primarily influenced by changes in one variable or multiple variables through hypothesis testing, examine if American residents adjust their consumption based on inflation, and finally, assess how the interaction between all variables and their impact on each other have evolved from 1929 to 2021.
