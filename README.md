# Analyzing US Consumption Habits

The objective of this project is to conduct a preliminary study on consumer behavior in the US market, focusing on understanding how consumers' actions are influenced by various variables such as income, inflation, and population.

This research will address the following key questions:
1. How does consumer behavior vary in response to changes in income levels, inflation rates, and population dynamics?
2. What factors contribute to increased consumer spending, and when do individuals exhibit a tendency to save or hoard their money?
3. Are there discernible patterns in purchasing behavior during specific economic conditions?

By addressing these questions, the study aims to provide valuable insights into the complexities of consumer behavior, enabling a better understanding of the underlying dynamics in the US market.
